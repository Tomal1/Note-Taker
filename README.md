# Note-Taker

## Description
A web application that uses client side technologies to build an user interface that takes a couple of inputs by the client and then stores those inputs into a server side API.
The API then extracts the relevant data to populate another section on the user interface for the client convenience.

## Usage
The note taker takes 2 inputs (test title and test text), when the client inputs both of these fields an image of a floppy disc will appear on the top right of the navbar.

If the floppy disc is clicked the two fields inputted will be displayed onto a left side column as a list.

If the any of the items on the left column are clicked, that item will be displayed on the right column once again.

On the top right of the navbar; a plus sign is displayed, if it is clicked the input fields will be emptied.
